# **COMPUTER**

*(Common Operating Machine Particularly Used for Technology and Educational Research)*

---

## **1. Fundamentals of Computer**

Computer fundamentals refer to the **basic understanding of how to use and navigate digital devices**, including how they interact with each other.

---

## **2. Components of a Computer**

A computer system consists of:

* **Hardware Components**: Physical parts like CPU, memory, storage.
* **Software Components**: Programs and data that tell the hardware what to do.

---

### **2.1 Hardware**

#### Main Parts:

* **Input Components/Devices**:
  Devices used to enter data into a computer.
  Examples: *Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Microphone*

* **Processing Components/Devices**:

  * **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
  * **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**
  * **GMCH / ICH (Motherboard)**

* **Output Components/Devices**:
  Devices that present information to the user.
  Examples: *Monitor, Printer, Speakers*

* **Memory Components/Devices**:

  * **Primary Memory**:

    * **RAM**: *(Random Access Memory)* – Volatile memory, loses data when power is off.
    * **ROM**: *(Read-Only Memory)*
  * **Secondary Memory**:
    Used for long-term data storage.
    Examples: *Hard Disk, SSD, USB Drive*

---

### **2.2 Software**

* **System Software**: OS, BIOS
* **Application Software**: VLC, Notepad, MS Paint
* **Utility Software**: Software designed to help analyze, configure, and maintain the computer

## **3. Operating System**

### Functions:

1. Memory Management
2. Task or Process Management
3. Storage Management
4. Device/Input-Output Management
5. Kernel or Scheduling Management

### Types:

* **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**

## **4. Machine and Device Differences**

* **Machine**:
  A physical system where **only mechanical or physical work** is done. It typically **uses Alternating Current (AC)**.

* **Device**:
  A system used for **logical or computational work**. It usually **requires Direct Current (DC)**.

---

## **5. Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC)**

* **Direct Current (DC)**: Constant flow of electricity in one direction.
* **Alternating Current (AC)**: Flow of electricity that changes direction periodically.
