### >   Fundamental of computer :-

                                                     Computer fundamentals is **the basic understanding of how to use and navigate digital devices, including how they interact with each other.**

### >   Alternating current and Direct current :-

                                                  **Direct current (DC) is a constant flow of electricity in one direction, while alternating current (AC) is a flow of electricity that changes direction periodically**.Â  

### >    Components of computer :-

                                                   A computer system consists of **hardware components (physical parts like CPU, memory, storage) and software components (programs and data that tell the**             

                                                  **hardware what to do)**.

### >    Input devices :-

                                                  These are **hardware components that allow users to enter data into the computer, such as keyboard, mouse, scanner, and microphone**.

### >   Machine :-

                                                 Machine is where the only physical work is done. the alternating current is used in machine .

### >    Device :-

                                                 Device is where the logical work is done. The Direct current is required in devices.
